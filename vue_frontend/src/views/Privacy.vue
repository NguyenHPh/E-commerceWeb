                    <p class="px-5">When you visit our website, register with us or place an order for products or services, you are providing data by filling in text boxes or clicking buttons. All of this information requires a direct action by you. We also collect information when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback, contact customers services and participate in competitions.</p>

                    <div class="group d-flex">
                        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right mr-3 ml-5"></i>

                    <p class="px-5">Depending on your settings or the privacy policies for other online services, you may give us permission to obtain information from your account with those other services. For example, if another website jointly runs a competition with us, they will send us a list of the entrants who opted to receive our email newsletter as part of their entry. The information we obtain from such third parties does depend on your settings for that service or their privacy policies, so you should always regularly check what those are. However, we will only arrange such joint-promotions if it is made clear how the data will shared with us.</p>

                    <p class="px-5">Whenever you use a website, or read email, there is certain information that gets created and recorded automatically by the IT systems behind the website or email service. For example:<br/>(a) When accessing Forthglade.com, we use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Forthglade account or your browser) to make it easier for you to use Forthglade.com, improve your shopping experience with us or so we can log data relating to the pages you viewed and activities you carried out during your visit. These cookies may be “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them). Some of the cookies we use are directly associated with your Forthglade account (relating to things like the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. There are more details on our cookie usage below.<br/>(b)In addition, the type of device you’re using to access Forthglade and the settings on that device may provide us with information about your device, including what type of device it is, what specific device you have, what operating system you’re using, what your device settings are, and why a crash has happened. What information we can be provided with depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. Your device manufacturer or operating system provider will have more details about what information your device makes available to us.</p>
